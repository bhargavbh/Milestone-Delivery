## :mailbox: Milestone Delivery Process

1. **Milestone Delivery:**
   1. [Fork](https://github.com/pioneersprize/Milestone-Delivery/fork) this repository with the **same GitHub account** that you used to submit the application.
   2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the milestone delivery template ([`deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md`](deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md)). If you're using the GitHub web interface, you will need to create a new file and copy the [contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pioneersprize/Milestone-Delivery/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md) of the template inside the new one. Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**. 
   3. Fill out the template with the details of your milestone, including all deliverables as listed in your application.
   4. Name the file `project_name-milestone_number.md` or in the case of maintenance agreement `project_name-delivery_number.md`
2. **Milestone Review:**
   1. Evaluators can (and usually do) issue comments and request changes on the pull request. Their feedback needs to be resolved before your milestone is accepted.
   2. Grants Evaluators will merge your pull request to accept the delivery.
