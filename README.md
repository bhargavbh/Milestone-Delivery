## :mailbox: Milestone Delivery Process

1. **Milestone Delivery:**
   1. [Fork](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/fork) this repository with the **same GitHub account** that you used to submit the application (ignore if you applied privately).
   2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the milestone delivery template ([`deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md`](deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md)). If you're using the GitHub web interface, you will need to create a new file and copy the [contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md) of the template inside the new one. Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**. In the case of a maintenance application, use the ([`maintenance template`](maintenance_deliveries/maintenance-delivery-template.md)) instead.
   5. Fill out the template with the details of your milestone, including all deliverables as listed in your application.
   4. Name the file `project_name-milestone_number.md` or in the case of maintenance agreement `project_name-delivery_number.md`
   5. Fill out the [invoice form](https://forms.gle/LSRr7PCjBpEbKGh89).
   6. Create a pull request and fill out the comment template.
2. **Milestone Review:**
   1. [Evaluators](https://grants.web3.foundation/docs/Introduction/team#w3f-grants-committee) can (and usually do) issue comments and request changes on the pull request. Their feedback needs to be resolved before your milestone is accepted.
   2. Grants Evaluators will merge your pull request to accept the delivery.
3. **Milestone Payment:**
   1. The [operations team](https://grants.web3.foundation/docs/Introduction/team#w3f-operations-team) receives a notification once the delivery is accepted. Payments are usually processed within 14 days.
   2. Payment is made to the bank account or Bitcoin, Polkadot, Kusama or Ethereum address specified in the initial application. The exchange rate for BTC depends on the time of payment.

Grant applications can be [amended](https://grants.web3.foundation/docs/Process/changes) at any time. However, this _necessitates a reevaluation by the committee_. If your application has been accepted and, during development, you find that your project significantly deviates from the original specification, please open a new pull request that modifies the existing application.
